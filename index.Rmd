## 1. Introduction

- This slidify deck was created to motivate a shiny app.
- The shiny app in question is available here:
  https://geekbert.shinyapps.io/frankscourseproject/ 
- it represents an interactive chart to analyse stock prices in software industry, 
  for 4 select stock (Facebook, Twitter, SAP, Software AG) and 3 select indices (DOW JONES, NASDAQ100, DAX) 

---

## 2. Results
```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(directlabels)
library(shiny)
library(shinyapps)
library(RCurl)
x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geekbert/DevelopingDataProducts/master/WeeklyStockPrices2014.csv", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
y <- read.csv(text = x)
y$DATE <- as.Date(y$DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
dataset <- y
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=DATE, y=RELATIVE_CHANGE, colour=SYMBOL)) + geom_line(aes(group=SYMBOL))
direct.label(ggplot(data=y, aes(x=DATE, y=RELATIVE_CHANGE, colour=SYMBOL)) + geom_line())
```

## 3. Further use cases

Further use cases: 
- generic trend analyses: % change over time, compared to peers
- Correlation Analysis: % change over time, including non-peers

## 4. Outlook

Outlook: 
- this kind of application is useful for a wide variety of use cases
- any person making decisions based on analysis would be well advised to have
  this as part of their skills repertoire
- End of Story (EOS)
